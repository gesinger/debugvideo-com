# Browser developer tools

As browser-based video devs, we may spend more of our lives in browser devtools than in our homes. Maybe they are our homes. It becomes second nature to open them, whether you're at a computer or reading a paperback book.

The most common devtools panels used by browser-based video devs are:

## Console

Viewing the console is useful as a first step, as it often provides error messages.

Check out the [console devtool guide](devtools-console).

## Network

If the cause of the issue isn't present in the console, the next place to check is the stream itself. This means viewing responses in the network panel.

Check out the [network devtool guide](devtools-network).

## Media

One feature unique to Chrome's devtools is the media panel, which must be enabled. This panel often reveals logs from Chrome's video decoders.
