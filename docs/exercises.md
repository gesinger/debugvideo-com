# Exercises

If you've read through the guide, or just want some practice, here are some exercises to hone your debugging skills.

Not all of these questions have a specific answer. Instead, they're geared towards making you consider possibilities.

And remember to have fun! Even if you encounter a `MEDIA_ERR_DECODE`.

1. A user reports playback issues when a segment 404s, but it only happens once every five hours of playback. How can you reproduce?
2. Gaps in the content leave playback stuck for ten seconds before the player automatically continues. How can you determine what's causing the gap?
3. A user reports that playback isn't working. How should you respond?
4. How can you debug overlapping content in a live stream?
5. What problems might make you look for manifest issues instead of segment issues?
