# How is this guide organized?

A *critical* ticket just came into our *insert enterprise ticketing system*. This means drop everything, hopefully not lunch, and figure out what's causing this issue.

This guide will walk step-by-step through a debugging process that may be applicable to any browser-based video player in the hope that we can get video playback, and lunch, to resume.

You may also use this guide as a checklist. Follow the links in the sidebar for a somewhat comprehensive series of debugging steps in a reasonable order.

Although this is meant as a guide to debugging, along the way we'll take pauses from our *critical ticket* to discuss relevant topics in the world of streaming video.
